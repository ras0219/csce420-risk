Risky Business
--------------

Rough structure of the framework:

 * Simulation class manages the list of agents, game graph, and dispatches 
   calls to the math model as needed to resolve moves.

 * MathModel class implements all maths required for the game; this should
   encapsulate all methods that would be rewritten to modify the level of 
   implemented chance.

 * Agent class is a superclass for agents to follow from.

Data structures:

  data Country = String
  data Edgelist = { Country : [Country] }
